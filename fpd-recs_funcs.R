# function for pattern 1, decoding factor variables: ---------------------------

  # the codebook under "Final Response Set".
  # Inputs:
  #  x - a vector of factor levels to be decoded, e.g. a column in recs data
  #  var - a length 1 character vector with names to be decoded
  #  codes - the codebook in which factor levels & labels are found as columns
  #           with those names and a row for which column "variable" matches 
  #           xname
  # Returns: x, transformed to a factor
  
  #if ( xname %in% codes$variable ) {
